Because nothing in this world is perfect, and they can suck my _you know what here_.

# So, what's this whole thing is about?
It's just a place where someone may want to just rant about anything and everything to their heart's content.

# Do we really need this?
Maybe. I'm not you, and you're not me, plus I'm not judging anyone. Everâ„¢. ðŸ˜‰

# OK you got my attention. Why did you create this project?
Nothing really. It's just an interesting topic that doesn't seem to be a common thing. ~~And because the rascals at [r/Homelab](https://reddit.com/r/homelab) totally did not peer-pressure me to make this project a real thing. I swear~~

# Do you get any benefits from this? It looks wasteful on the fact that you paid money for a domain.
I do. This project is intended to practice hybrid cloud environments where the website will be hosted in an on-premise configuration and will be exposed to cloud for resiliency.

It also aims to have minimal user interaction to set up as this application will be completely deployed using automation tools (Ansible) to remove user errors on setting up the application. ~~And because humans are full of fail.~~

# Are these rants real?
ðŸ™ƒ
